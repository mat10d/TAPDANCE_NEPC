# This perl script is called by multiple scripts within the lib folder.
# This script will set up the database interface, set the table name suffixes,
#	set the percentages for CIS calculations, and set the annotation file
# The subroutine "resolve_barcodes" and "resolve_IRDR" will create tables that 
#	identify and remove barcodes and IRDR sequences from the input sequences

# 10/26/18: The database currently being used is TKS MySQL database at MSI
